# Calculator

This project will be combining everything I learned so far in The Odin Project and making an on-screen calculator with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Information and Goals

* Create four functions that add, subtract, multiply, and divide

* Use a new function that takes an operator and 2 numbers and then calls one of the above functions on the numbers

* Design a basic calculator with buttons and appropriate numbers/equal sign in HTML/CSS

* Make another function that populates the calculator display when clicking the buttons. I will need to figure out the overall logic in how every function and variable work together. 

* Use Git and push code to GitHub
